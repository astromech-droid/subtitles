00:03:38.986: Right there.
00:03:41.613: See? The door.
00:03:41.613: You left it wide open.
00:03:44.199: (ALL MURMURING)
00:03:45.325: And leaving the door open is the worst mistake any employee can make because...

00:03:52.207: -WATERNOOSE: It could let in a child.
00:03:57.129: Oh! Mr. Waternoose.

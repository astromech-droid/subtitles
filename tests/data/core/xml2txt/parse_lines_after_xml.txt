00:00:06.917: [boy] Woo-hoo!

00:00:44.417: [energy humming]
00:00:49.917: [speaking alien language]
00:01:30.208: [Kid] Yes, finally!
00:01:32.417: [opening theme music plays]
00:01:57.917: Hello, destiny!
00:02:02.458: [singer vocalizing]
00:02:14.708: [imitates laser fire]
00:02:20.250: Yeah!
00:02:23.292: Yeah!
00:02:24.250: [vocalizing] Yeah, yeah, yeah!
00:02:26.083: Hi-yah! Hi-yah! [chuckles]
00:02:33.958: Thanks, Papa G! I'm off to save the day!
00:02:36.375: Go get 'em, Kid!
00:02:38.583: [grunts]
00:02:51.708: [chuckles]
00:02:53.792: [panting]
00:02:57.708: Ah, I'm a monster!
00:02:59.375: Whoa! No, Rosa, no! I got important news to tell the town!
00:03:03.333: No! Let's play!
00:03:05.625: Heroes don't have time to play. Besides, you're too little!
00:03:09.417: [Rosa] I'm not little!
00:03:14.917: [Kid] Not in the road.
00:03:17.375: Stay safe, citizen!
00:03:20.708: [grunting]
00:03:26.875: [groans]
00:03:36.750: [woman clears throat]
00:03:39.375: [clears throat]
00:03:40.375: Jo!
00:03:42.375: Refills.
00:03:45.708: Ugh!
00:03:47.958: Don't ugh me. No coffee, no customers.
00:03:52.375: Aw, Mom, Carl, Carla, and Carlos aren't going anywhere.
00:03:55.208: They've been in those spots forever.
00:03:57.458: I don't know about that now.
00:03:59.333: There was that time Carlos sat over there.
00:04:01.833: Ah, it was a wild adventure.
00:04:04.208: You want adventure? Look!
00:04:05.833: Discount airfare to New York! Hollywood! Boise!
00:04:09.208: Who wants to go tear it up in Boise? Woo-hoo!
00:04:16.208: Who wants refills?
00:04:17.542: [customers] Woo-hoo!
00:04:20.208: Ugh!
00:04:22.375: Sorry, honey.  That's as wild as it gets around here.
00:04:26.042: -[door swings open] -Fair patrons of Mo's Oasis Cafe!
00:04:29.708: -Oh no! -Oh yes!
00:04:31.833: I've stumbled onto something big.
00:04:36.042: -A crashed spaceship… -Gotcha!
00:04:38.250: …has bestowed me with five Cosmic Rings of Power!
00:04:43.083: -[groans] -[Kid] And I shall use them to save everybody from evil…
00:04:48.458: [dishes clatter]
00:04:49.625: …alien invaders!
00:04:53.500: You're the invader!
00:04:54.500: -Hi-yah! -[clattering]
00:04:56.375: Oh no!
00:05:00.167: Huh. Your super rings just look like rocks glued to hex nuts.
00:05:04.708: Aha! Good catch, Carla! [grunts]
00:05:07.042: That's because they are.
00:05:08.958: 'Cause it looks way cooler when I do this!
00:05:11.500: [Kid] Hoo-wah! Ha! Ka-sha!
00:05:14.875: Hope the glue didn't ruin their powers.
00:05:17.333: [customers laughing]
00:05:18.708: Oh no.
00:05:21.167: [clattering]
00:05:24.542: Oh no!
00:05:26.500: I know what you're thinking.
00:05:28.125: Cosmic Rings? Like in movies and comic books?
00:05:30.958: Yes, exactly! But this?
00:05:33.583: This is real!
00:05:35.708: I'll discover their powers, and whenever alien invaders rear their ugly heads, if they have heads, I'll be there! Yes, I will.
00:05:44.042: Yes, I will. Yes, I will.
00:05:46.208: Yes! Maybe a call to your grandpap will teach you not to--
00:05:49.833: -[rings] -Mo’s Oasis, “Like No Other Place Is,"
00:05:52.458: -how can I help? - I'd like a to-go order.
00:05:54.958: [man whistles] Hamburg, order up!
00:05:57.500: -Eighteen short stacks, 12 tall stacks-- -What are you doing? We got him.
00:06:00.958: Four hamburgers, six burgers with cheese, not cheeseburgers, five cheeseburgers, and the trout almandine.
00:06:07.792: How long does that take?
00:06:15.083: [grunting]
00:06:16.167: -[yells] -[screams]
00:06:19.625: -Have no fear… -[door bells jingle]
00:06:21.625: …Kid Cosmic is here!
00:06:24.458: [door bells jingle]
00:06:32.083: Jo!
00:06:34.750: People of Earth! Found power rings from space. Don't know how they work.
00:06:38.333: Gonna activate them so I can protect Earth from evil space aliens.
00:06:41.667: Okay.
00:06:42.792: Let's do this.
00:06:46.333: -[energetic rock music playing] -Hi-yah!
00:06:51.042: Hi-yah!
00:06:53.625: Hi-yah!
00:06:55.375: Hmm.
00:06:57.000: Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
00:06:59.583: [exclaiming]
00:07:06.875: Maybe I gotta go faster.
00:07:09.792: [exclaims]
00:07:11.750: [grunts]
00:07:13.917: Secret code word!
00:07:15.500: Activate! Go, ring, go!
00:07:17.792: Do your thing, ring!
00:07:21.042: Duh, they're from space! Talk alien talk.
00:07:24.292: [speaking gibberish]
00:07:31.625: Maybe it's out of juice.
00:07:45.667: Aw, come on! The earth is watching. What am I doing wrong?
00:07:51.167: Behold the power of the Cosmic Ring of Power!
00:07:55.375: Hi-yah!
00:07:58.667: Yes! Yes! Yes!
00:08:00.667: Ha ha!
00:08:01.917: It's working! It's--
00:08:03.458: [truck horn blares]
00:08:09.250: Ah!
00:08:11.458: [grunting]
00:08:32.833: Sorry… people of Earth.
00:08:39.625: It's just…  sometimes things make me mad.
00:08:44.042: And I just gotta remember, like Papa G says…
00:08:47.833: "Freakin' out? Breathe it out.
00:08:50.625: Freakin' out? Breathe it out."
00:08:53.833: [exhales]
00:08:55.500: [energy hums]
00:09:01.542: Wha-- What? It's working! It's--
00:09:04.375: Whoa!
00:09:08.208: Wow!
00:09:09.125: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
00:09:12.333: This is amazing and terrifying!
00:09:15.458: Whoa! Ah!
00:09:30.667: [groans]
00:09:31.917: Dumb Kid getting caught.
00:09:33.667: Dumb Mom making me clean up after him and pay for the food I ordered.
00:09:38.417: Oh, I'll show her. Gonna eat this trout so hard…
00:09:42.208: Ow!
00:09:43.167: [Kid screaming, grunts]
00:09:48.333: This one makes you fly!
00:09:49.792: Woo-hoo!
00:09:53.875: The ring is real?
00:09:55.708: Are there more?  Where did you get them? How do they work?
00:09:58.958: Yes. Five, from a crashed spaceship.  I don't know. I explained this earlier.
00:10:03.917: Yeah, but I kind of, sort of thought you were being weird like always.
00:10:10.250: Oh.
00:10:13.458: You didn't help me to save the town from evil aliens?
00:10:16.792: Look, Kid…
00:10:17.917: You helped me just to help me?
00:10:20.583: Wanna see something cool?
00:10:25.167: [Jo] Is this your home?
00:10:27.083: No, my headquarters. Though I often sleep and eat here, so yes.
00:10:31.667: Behold the other Cosmic Rings of Power.
00:10:34.750: Each capable of bestowing the wearer with amazing abilities.
00:10:38.500: These three-- Wait, three? There were four!
00:10:41.167: -What villainous villain-- -Activate!
00:10:43.833: Ring powers go.
00:10:45.542: Zip-zap-zim! Something else spacey!
00:10:48.083: One, that's not how they work. Two, give it back!
00:10:51.250: It's probably really dangerous in the wrong hands.
00:10:54.500: Which is why we should test them out together.
00:10:57.250: You need help in case of a class-ten introversal exploda-magorium scenario, right?
00:11:03.167: Of course, you're right!
00:11:05.167: Get used to it, Kid. Now…
00:11:07.125: How do I make something happen?
00:11:10.125: -Relax. -I don't want to relax.
00:11:12.167: I want superpowers!
00:11:13.583: No, listen. You gotta want it… But not  want  it.
00:11:18.208: I know it's hard not to think about having superpowers, but don't!
00:11:22.542: And you will.
00:11:24.500: Freakin' out? Breathe it out.
00:11:27.583: Freakin' out? Breathe it out.
00:11:30.458: -[energy humming] -Eh?
00:11:35.750: [sighs]
00:11:42.708: [Jo screams]
00:11:49.750: [Jo screams]
00:11:51.875: I hate meditating!
00:11:53.375: Oh, it's not so-- Bad!
00:11:55.958: So, so bad!
00:11:57.917: Oh, Jo. Sweet Jo.
00:12:00.542: Your noble sacrifice will be remembered.
00:12:04.000: [Jo screams]
00:12:11.208: Cool! Teleportation portals!
00:12:15.292: I'm coming, Jo!
00:12:16.375: [repeating] Freakin' out? Breathe it out.
00:12:18.625: [screams]
00:12:20.125: [screaming]
00:12:22.583: Kid! What's going on out here? Everything cool?
00:12:25.417: [Kid] Just using my superpowers to help Jo get her head back on!
00:12:30.042: [Papa G] Okey-doke!
00:12:31.250: Whoo! Comin' around! And again!
00:12:34.833: Starting to feel a little sick.
00:12:50.708: Oh, that's so crazy but so cool!
00:13:00.375: [gasps]
00:13:02.375: [Jo screaming]
00:13:03.708: [grunts]
00:13:08.250: Ugh!
00:13:10.250: -Ah! -[Kid yelling]
00:13:14.833: Yes! We have… mastered our abilities.
00:13:18.208: [Kid vomiting]
00:13:21.458: Now we do what we were meant to, save our town from galactic threats.
00:13:25.000: -Leave town for adventure. -[both] What did you say?
00:13:28.917: Why would we leave? This place has it all: good people, good eats.
00:13:32.833: Met them, eaten that.  We could see the world, do something big.
00:13:36.625: Like save our town from galactic threats!
00:13:38.917: Please! What "galactic threats"  are gonna attack this place?
00:13:47.833: [gasps]
00:13:49.667: Yes! So, invading scum!
00:13:53.250: -Whoa! -[Jo screams]
00:13:58.417: Let go! Heroes don't hide!
00:14:00.417: He didn't do it right. He's supposed to declare his name, planet of origin, and evil intentions before opening fire.
00:14:06.792: See? This guy goes on for a page and a half. There are rules!
00:14:10.792: This isn't the comics. This is real life and we're about to die!
00:14:15.458: -[snarls] -[both scream]
00:14:18.208: Ah!
00:14:24.750: [alien grunting]
00:14:30.750: What's your name? Where are you from? Who do you work for?
00:14:33.500: What's his name? Or hers? Are you a her? How does it feel to be defeated by Kid Cosmic and his sidekick Jo?
00:14:38.625: Sidekick?
00:14:39.583: [speaking alien language]
00:14:49.667: Cállate, dame los anillos o muere!
00:14:51.833: Fermez-vous, donnez-moi les anneaux ou meurs!
00:14:54.542: Halt die Klappe, gib mir die Ringe oder stirbst!
00:14:57.458: Damare, watashi ni ringu o atae tari, shinu!
00:14:59.917: Shut up! Gimme the stones or die!
00:15:02.292: [both] Oh!
00:15:05.625: [both scream]
00:15:06.792: [alien] Ah!
00:15:18.125: No! [strains]
00:15:26.250: -We did it! -Woo-hoo!
00:15:27.750: You cut that guy in half, sorta!
00:15:29.750: -I saw you get caught-- -Heroes don't get caught!
00:15:32.792: No, you were cool too. When you grabbed me and ran away--
00:15:36.417: Heroes don't run away!
00:15:38.750: -[gasps] -[creature snarls]
00:15:43.917: -Ah! -[roars]
00:15:50.500: We can make an exception!
00:15:59.000: [repeating] Wrong, wrong, wrong.
00:16:03.458: Call off your stooge, you menace!
00:16:05.583: My what now?
00:16:06.792: That giant-dog-monster-alien thing.
00:16:09.125: What? Another alien? Already?
00:16:12.125: Yeah! It was a black, furry,  evil alien death dog of doom!
00:16:16.083: It's wired up to some kind of crazy mind-control collar. So call it off!
00:16:20.625: Ah! It's starting sooner than I expected.
00:16:23.208: The Great Leader thought we had a jump on this.
00:16:25.083: I gotta stop you before it does. [grunts]
00:16:27.708: Kid, I don't think he's controlling that.
00:16:30.292: But the invasion! They're bad guys and we're good guys.
00:16:33.792: They come, and we stop them and save the day, right?
00:16:36.833: Foolish Earthlings! You think there's just one bad guy?
00:16:40.125: Those stones possess powers every evil being in the universe would kill for!
00:16:44.917: Soon as they realize  the stones are here, they'll come to this weird, little planet to fight a cosmic war to get them.
00:16:52.083: Your Earth is doomed!
00:16:56.042: Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna form a team of the best heroes on Earth.
00:17:00.167: We're gonna use the rings to stop all of you, no matter how many there are. Right, Jo?
00:17:15.708: -Where are you going? -Out of here!
00:17:17.875: This went from a place where nothing happened to way too much happening!
00:17:21.458: -But we were chosen to protect the Earth. -No! We were just having fun!
00:17:25.875: You know who swears to protect people?
00:17:28.000: The cops. The military. The government.
00:17:30.625: Let them handle this!
00:17:33.250: No, they can't know!
00:17:35.000: [Jo] Why not?
00:17:36.042: They'll just take it away!
00:17:38.083: No one believes I do anything right.
00:17:40.458: I just want a chance to prove I'm more than…
00:17:43.625: Just the weird kid down the road?
00:17:45.792: With these powers, we can stop bad things from happening.
00:17:49.125: Besides, people like us never get a chance to have adventures.
00:17:53.208: If the world ends today, all we'll have been was--
00:17:56.208: Just a waitress.
00:17:58.833: And the really cool kid down the road.
00:18:06.500: Ugh!
00:18:08.083: Okay, fine. We'll be heroes…
00:18:10.417: Whoo!
00:18:11.333: Ow! Watch it!
00:18:13.292: Sorry, sorry!
00:18:16.083: If we do this, we're not telling anybody.
00:18:18.625: Not the cops, the government, military, town. Nobody.
00:18:21.917: Especially my mom!
00:18:23.333: If she finds out, she'll kill me before evil aliens do. Got it?
00:18:26.625: Got it. It's like having secret identities.
00:18:28.875: So, what's the plan?
00:18:30.708: Plan?
00:18:37.458: [creature snarling]
00:18:41.458: [Kid] Whoa!
00:18:44.083: Oh!
00:18:46.417: Um…
00:18:48.208: Okay, but you're not gonna like it.
00:18:59.042: [Kid] Hey!
00:19:00.542: Get away from that lovingly-prepared entree!
00:19:04.542: [beeping]
00:19:07.542: [snarls]
00:19:12.583: [screaming]
00:19:14.375: This isn't running away, it's saving the day!
00:19:17.417: Freakin' out? Breathe it out. Freakin' out? Breathe it out.
00:19:22.375: Ah!
00:19:24.792: Who wants it?
00:19:26.208: Who wants my Ring of Power? You do! You do!
00:19:30.833: [grunting] Give it!
00:19:33.417: You're gonna have to blast me first.
00:19:35.750: You gonna blast me? You gonna blast me? Or are you too chicken?
00:19:40.125: [clucks]
00:19:42.000: I have no idea what that means,  but it sounds offensive. You are so dead!
00:19:46.083: Good. Let's do this.
00:19:51.583: -I hope this works! -I hope this works! I hope this works!
00:19:58.250: Let's… do… this!
00:20:16.292: -[Kid laughs] -We did it!
00:20:18.500: Yes! Yes! Yes! It totally worked!
00:20:21.083: -Way to go, Jo. -Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
00:20:23.875: [alien] You'll never survive.
00:20:25.417: You're just nobodies on a little, nowhere planet.
00:20:29.083: Your Earth is doomed.
00:20:31.458: Nuh-uh, because we shall band together with similar heroes, pure of heart and noble of purpose to wield the Cosmic Rings of Power, and together--
00:20:41.917: Hey, I was still speeching!
00:20:48.833: [both] Ha!
00:20:49.750: [alien] You realize you could've used that to destroy me?
00:20:52.667: You guys are really bad at this.
00:20:55.208: -[groans] -We'll get better.
00:20:57.417: [alien] You won't!
00:21:04.583: [Jo's mother screams]
00:21:06.250: They're perfect!
00:21:07.667: Exactly like the ones my mother had in the diner when I was growing up!
00:21:13.167: Oh!
00:21:14.792: [gasps] The creamer.
00:21:17.833: -Super rare. -[door bells jingle]
